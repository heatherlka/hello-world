Git-hub tutorial practice.
I have decided to use Git-hub as my repository for my cert projects for fcc and other learning experiences. I know that both fcc and Future Learn suggest CodePen and I do like the layout of CodePen, I would prefer to be able to work 'offline' and outside my browsers. So after looking and trying different programs out, I am giving BlueGriffon a try, thus, I need somewhere to put my projects so they can be reviewed, tested, and accessed. And this gives me the chance to learn Git-hub better.
